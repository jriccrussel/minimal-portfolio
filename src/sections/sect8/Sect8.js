                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from being a Front-End Developer, I also love watching series and spend most of my free time exploring and trying out the latest trends in websites and other web app technologies. I also enjoy listening to podcasts and music, especially hip-hop, jazz, deep house, lofi music, and tropical house.
